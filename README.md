Fragments back-end API

Run eslint : **npm run lint**

Server can be started manually: **node src/server.js** or **npm start**

Server can also be started with:</br>
**npm run dev** - dev runs it via nodemon, which watches the src/** folder for any changes, restarting the server whenever something is updated </br>
or</br>
**npm run debug** - debug is the same as dev but also starts the node inspector on port 9229, so that you can attach a debugger</br>
